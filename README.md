# Simple Node Hosting Template

This is a template for deployment of a basic Node Express app to an Ubuntu 14.04 VPS.

I built this as a base template for setting up a simple Node app as I was sick of mucking around with doing this over and over again.

I am not a highly trained server admin and there will certainly be faults with my code or things that can be done better or things that make sense for an app with higher scalability concerns.

This however works for my most basic common usecase that I get from my clients which is a node app hosted on a single VPS with basic git hosted scripts for deploying.

This may be written in the future with ansible. However for now, and for this usecase, bash scripts work fine.
